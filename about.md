## Selfie

I was born in and continue to reside in Toronto. Latest rankings give the city a 29 out of 48 (measured in units of measurement; accurate to 8 microunits). I studied English and Ancient Literature at uBoronto. Started a PhD even. I&rsquo;d still like to write about the Greek poet Anacreon one day, but strictly for pleasure. I&rsquo;m also nearly done a Digital Media certificate at OCAD. (`def courses = ["introductory illustrator", "intermediate photoshop", "art of type", "graphic design: past, present, future", "intermediate illustrator"]`.)

I am self taught as a web designer, with thanks to Prof. J.S. Burgess at UofT who encouraged me to try it out. I&rsquo;ve been doing it professionally since the fall of 2011, with a focus on custom WordPress sites. (With my subscriptions to [Treehouse](http://teamtreehouse.com/scallemang) and Tuts+, I'm currently focusing on learning Ruby and improving my Illustrator and Photoshop.) I work at a youth club as their web designer, in addition to teaching game design programs and coordinating a Saturday school program. I volunteer as a Mentor with CoderDojoTo, and am co-developing [Techsdale](http://techsdale.ca) with [Andray Domise](http://twitter.com/andraydomise) a tech-focused rec. centre in Rexdale. I&rsquo;m available for freelance web design work through Toronto-based studio, [Cloud Surfing Media](http://cloudsurfingmedia.com).
